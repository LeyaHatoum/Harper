# HARPER by Leya Hatoum
A multi-page responsive site.

## Brief
The brief I was provided included the desktop designs of a multi-page website. I was given the task to code three pages: the homepage, blog page, and the contact page, and to develop a fully responsive and accessible version of the site.

## Requirements
- Make design/ux decisions on how the site will look and interact on various devices.
- Use Sass
- Use BEM
And, of course: *clean, DRY, and easy-to-read code.*

## Built With
- Sass using Prepros
